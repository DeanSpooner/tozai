# TOKYO METRO TOZAI SIMULATOR
## By Dean Spooner

Welcome to my project, where you can 'simulate' driving and travelling on the Tokyo Metro Tozai line! Starting at station T1, Nakano, you can travel as far on the line as you like.

Inspired by [Manchester Codes Cruise Ship project](https://github.com/MCRcodes/cruise-ships).
